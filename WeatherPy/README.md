Weather Data Analysis.
--------------------------------------------

1. As we are close to the equator the weather gets warmer, and humid., also we can see the earth tilt effect obliquity


*Example Data as below:

|City	              |Humidity	  |Max Temperature		|
|---------------------|:---------:|:-------------------:|
|Macapa                |100        |77              	|
|Bontang               |76         |88               	|
|Thinadhoo			   |77         |81              	|

2. There is no strong correlation betweeen cloudiness and latitude, nor Windspeed and latitude(Reference Visualizations Output Data)



3. Although its not consistent, windspeed appears to increase away from equator, that can also result in the effect of reduced temperature.
